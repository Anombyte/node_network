# Collaborative AI Node Network

## **Project Description**
This project is a dynamic, reusable Python application that connects AI models (nodes) into a collaborative network. Nodes specialize in tasks and adapt to user preferences through reinforcement learning and feedback.

## **Key Features**
- Modular design with a base `Node` class and specialized subclasses.
- Orchestrator for managing task delegation and collaboration.
- Feedback-driven learning using a preference model.
- Iterative refinement and node weighting for optimization.

## **Setup Instructions**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python main.py
