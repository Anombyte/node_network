# Reference Tasks: Collaborative AI Node Network

This file outlines all detailed low-level tasks for building the MVP, organized by phases and sprints. Use it as a quick reference to track progress and revisit specific implementation steps if needed.

## **Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product**

### **Sprint 1: Project Setup and Base Node**
1. **Set Up the Project Structure**
   - Create a Git repository and set up `.gitignore` for Python projects.
   - Organize the file structure with folders for `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, and `portfolio/`.
   - Initialize a virtual environment and install essential libraries (`openai`, `sklearn`, `pytest`, etc.).
   - Create a `requirements.txt` to document all dependencies.
   - Add an entry point (`main.py`) for running the application.
   - Set up linting and formatting tools like `flake8` and `black`.
   - Write a basic `README.md` with a brief overview of the project.
   - Set up version control hooks using tools like `pre-commit`.
   - Create a base test suite (`test_node.py`) for testing the Node class structure.
   - Document the project setup in the `portfolio/` folder.

2. **Implement the Base Node Class**
   - Define the `Node` class with shared attributes like `node_id`, `description`, and `priority`.
   - Add task management methods like `process_task` and `set_priority`.
   - Implement status tracking with attributes like `status` and methods to update the node's activity state.
   - Include attributes for collaboration metadata (e.g., dependencies and supported tasks).
   - Write unit tests to verify the `Node` class methods.
   - Add docstrings to document the purpose and usage of each method.
   - Integrate logging functionality to track node activity.
   - Document the design and implementation of the `Node` class in the portfolio.
   - Push the completed `Node` class implementation and tests to Git.
   - Generate a portfolio entry explaining the purpose of the `Node` class and its role in the MVP.

### **Sprint 2: Specialized Nodes**
1. **Implement Specialized Subclasses**
   - Create the `GPTNode` class by extending the `Node` class for OpenAI GPT functionality.
   - Integrate the OpenAI API for processing tasks within the `GPTNode` class.
   - Create the `HuggingFaceNode` class by extending the `Node` class for Hugging Face integrations.
   - Add configuration management for API-specific settings in subclasses.
   - Implement feature extraction methods for preference modeling.
   - Write unit tests for both `GPTNode` and `HuggingFaceNode`.
   - Add fallback logic for handling API failures in subclasses.
   - Document the creation of specialized subclasses in the portfolio.
   - Push the subclass implementations and tests to Git.
   - Generate portfolio entries explaining the roles of `GPTNode` and `HuggingFaceNode`.

## **Phase 2: Adaptive Intelligence**

### **Sprint 3: Building the Orchestrator**
1. **Design and Implement the Orchestrator**
   - Create the orchestrator class to manage node interactions and task routing.
   - Add methods for node registration and tracking.
   - Implement task delegation logic to route tasks based on priority and availability.
   - Add collaboration logic to manage interactions within node groups.
   - Enable phase management to shift priorities dynamically.
   - Write unit tests to validate task delegation and priority logic.
   - Add logging functionality to track task assignments and node interactions.
   - Document the orchestrator design and implementation in the portfolio.
   - Push the orchestrator implementation and tests to Git.
   - Generate a portfolio entry explaining the orchestratorâ€™s role.

### **Sprint 4: Feedback and Preference Model**
1. **Integrate Feedback Mechanisms**
   - Design the preference model to predict user preferences based on features and feedback.
   - Implement a classifier (e.g., `sklearn` logistic regression) for the preference model.
   - Add methods to collect and store feedback (binary, graded, or qualitative).
   - Train the model on collected feedback and enable preference scoring.
   - Integrate the preference model into the orchestrator for refining task outputs.
   - Write unit tests to verify feedback collection and preference model integration.
   - Document the feedback mechanism in the portfolio.
   - Push feedback model implementation and tests to Git.
   - Generate a portfolio entry explaining the preference model and its integration.

### **Phase 3: Refinement and Scalability**

### **Sprint 5: Feedback Loops and Node Contributions**
1. **Refine Node Collaboration and Feedback**
   - Implement feedback loops to adjust outputs iteratively.
   - Introduce node weighting based on contributions to preferred solutions.
   - Add logic to replace underperforming nodes with better-performing variants.
   - Enable real-time feedback for dynamic solution adjustment.
   - Write unit tests to verify feedback integration and node weighting.
   - Document feedback loop implementation in the portfolio.
   - Push the feedback loop implementation and tests to Git.
   - Generate a portfolio entry explaining the feedback loop and its impact.

### **Sprint 6: Final Testing and Deployment**
1. **Refine and Test the System**
   - Optimize node collaboration logic for efficiency.
   - Enhance logging and metrics tracking for tasks and solutions.
   - Add dynamic configuration updates for runtime flexibility.
   - Implement error recovery mechanisms for nodes and the orchestrator.

2. **Perform Integration Testing**
   - Validate communication between nodes in various scenarios.
   - Test phase transitions to ensure priority changes work seamlessly.
   - Test preference model integration for improved alignment over time.

3. **Finalize Documentation**
   - Generate user and developer guides.
   - Complete portfolio entries summarizing the MVP development process.
   - Push the final MVP to Git.
