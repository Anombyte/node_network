# Project Roadmap: Collaborative AI Node Network

## **Project Purpose**
To create a collaborative network of AI nodes that adapt dynamically to user preferences and solve complex tasks. This roadmap outlines the steps to build the minimum viable product (MVP) and extend it into a scalable, intelligent system.

---

## **Phases and Sprints**

### **Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**
**Goal:** Build the foundational components of the node network, enabling basic collaboration and feedback integration.

#### **Sprint 1: Project Setup and Base Node**
- Organize the repository and create the foundational `Node` class.
- Tasks:
  1. Set up the Git repository and folder structure.
  2. Create `README.md` with project description.
  3. Add roadmap and task list.
  4. Set up a virtual environment and dependencies (`requirements.txt`).
  5. Implement the base `Node` class with attributes like `node_id`, `description`, `priority`, and `status`.
  6. Write unit tests for the `Node` class.
  7. Add logging functionality to the `Node` class.
  8. Document the base `Node` class in the portfolio.

#### **Sprint 2: Specialized Nodes**
- Extend the `Node` class to create specialized nodes for specific AI models.
- Tasks:
  1. Create the `GPTNode` subclass for OpenAI integration.
  2. Implement the OpenAI API integration for task processing.
  3. Create feature extraction methods for preference modeling.
  4. Add tests for the `GPTNode` subclass.
  5. Document the `GPTNode` in the portfolio.

#### **Sprint 3: Orchestrator**
- Build the orchestrator to manage tasks and facilitate collaboration between nodes.
- Tasks:
  1. Design the orchestrator class.
  2. Add methods for task delegation, priority management, and collaboration.
  3. Implement phase-based task prioritization.
  4. Write unit tests for orchestrator functionality.
  5. Document the orchestrator in the portfolio.

#### **Sprint 4: Feedback and Preference Model**
- Add feedback-driven learning and integrate a preference model.
- Tasks:
  1. Design the preference model to predict user preferences.
  2. Implement feedback collection mechanisms (binary, graded, qualitative).
  3. Integrate the preference model with the orchestrator.
  4. Test the feedback mechanism with sample tasks.
  5. Document the preference model and feedback system in the portfolio.

### **Phase 2: Adaptive Intelligence**
**Goal:** Enhance adaptability by refining node contributions and improving feedback loops.

#### **Sprint 5: Weighted Node Contributions**
- Add dynamic weighting for nodes and implement replacement mechanisms.
- Tasks:
  1. Introduce node weighting based on contribution to preferred solutions.
  2. Add logic to replace underperforming nodes dynamically.
  3. Test the dynamic node system.
  4. Document the node weighting and replacement mechanism in the portfolio.

#### **Sprint 6: Refinement and Scaling**
- Optimize the system for scalability and support additional AI models.
- Tasks:
  1. Refine orchestrator logic to handle larger networks.
  2. Add logging and metrics tracking for scalability.
  3. Integrate a second AI model (e.g., Hugging Face) as a new node subclass.
  4. Document the scalability improvements in the portfolio.
