# Portfolio Entry: Base AI_Node Class
**Date Completed:** 29/12/2024

**Project Repository:** [Node Network GitHub](https://github.com/hbruinsma/node_network)

## **Objective**
To implement the foundational `AI_Node` class that serves as the base for all specialized nodes in the bot net.

## Overview
The `AI_Node` class is the core abstraction for specialized AI nodes in the Node Network system. Each node is designed to process tasks, collaborate with other nodes, and contribute to the final solution iteratively.

## **Details**
- Attributes: `name`, `purpose`, `task`, `node_id`, `description`, `status`, `priority`.
- Methods: `get_details()`, `set_status()`, `__str__()` `set_task()`, `process_task()`, `set_priority()`

## **Challenges**
- Designing a structure that is both simple and extensible.
- Ensuring the class can handle future scalability.

## **Lessons Learned**
- **Iterative Design is Key:** Starting simple and incrementally adding functionality saved me from being overwhelmed by complexity.
- **AI as a Partner, Not a Solution:** Using AI to validate ideas and suggest alternatives was far more effective than blindly following its solutions.
- **Debugging Builds Understanding:** The process of fixing threading errors deepened my understanding of resource management.
- **Logging is Invaluable:** Beyond monitoring, logging became essential for debugging and refining program logic.

## **Welcome to the AI_Node Journey**

This entry documents the process of designing and implementing the `AI_Node` class, the foundation of the Node Network system. The `AI_Node` serves as the blueprint for specialized AI nodes, enabling task processing, collaboration, and contribution to recursive workflows.

---

## **Objective**

To create a foundational `AI_Node` class that is:
- **Simple yet Extensible**: Designed to scale as new features and requirements are introduced.
- **Collaborative**: Capable of interacting with other nodes and adapting dynamically.
- **Efficient**: Handles tasks and metadata efficiently while prioritizing scalability.

---

## **My Journey**

### **Step 1: Designing the AI_Node**
- **What I Did**:  
  Started by defining core attributes (`name`, `purpose`, `status`, etc.) and basic methods for functionality (`process_task`, `set_status`, etc.).  
- **What I Learned**:  
  Starting with a simple design and iterating gradually helps avoid over-complicating the system early on.

### **Step 2: Adding Logging Functionality**
- **What I Did**:  
  Integrated a `LoggerMixin` to handle structured logging across the system, enabling better debugging and monitoring.  
- **Why It’s Important**:  
  Logging became critical as I started dealing with threading and task execution issues, helping me understand program flow.

### **Step 3: Writing and Running Unit Tests**
- **What I Did**:  
  Created unit tests to verify that the class methods (`process_task`, `set_task`, etc.) functioned correctly.  
- **What I Learned**:  
  Writing test cases early on not only ensures functionality but also provides clarity about edge cases.

## **Challenges and Solutions**

### **1. Challenge: Balancing Simplicity and Extensibility**
- **Problem:** How to design a class that’s simple to implement now but extensible for future features.  
- **Solution:** Started with core attributes and methods, keeping modularity in mind for future enhancements.

---

### **2. Challenge: Threading Issues**
- **Problem:** Threading logic caused deadlocks when multiple nodes attempted to access shared resources.  
- **Solution:** Switched to using `RThreading` and implemented proper thread lock management, preventing recursive locks.

---

### **3. Challenge: Debugging Complex Dependencies**
- **Problem:** Nodes with interdependencies introduced ambiguous errors during registration and execution.  
- **Solution:** Enhanced logging to capture detailed dependency errors and updated node registration logic to handle edge cases.

---

## **Lessons Learned**

1. **Iterative Design Matters**: Starting small and iterating made it easier to adapt the design as the project grew.
2. **AI is a Partner, Not a Replacement**: Collaborating with AI helped refine my ideas, but I needed to understand the solutions deeply to implement them effectively.
3. **Logging is Essential**: Beyond debugging, logging became a tool for understanding program flow and improving performance.

---

## **Code Snippet: Final AI_Node Implementation**
```python
class AI_Node(LoggerMixin):
    def __init__(self, in_name, in_node_id, in_description, in_priority, in_status, in_purpose, in_task):
        super().__init__() # Initialize loggers from LoggerMixin which include 'default', 'debugger' and 'error_logger'

        # Assign class attributes
        self.name = in_name
        self.node_id = in_node_id or str(uuid.uuid4())  # Use provided ID or generate a UUID
        self.description = in_description
        self.status = in_status
        self.purpose = in_purpose
        self.task = in_task
        self.set_priority(self, in_priority)
```

## Reflections

### What Worked
- The `LoggerMixin` made logging intuitive and reusable for future nodes.
- Breaking down the `AI_Node` implementation into smaller, testable chunks saved time debugging later.

### What Didn’t Work
- Over-reliance on AI-generated solutions early on led to several redesigns as I realized I needed a deeper understanding of the code.

---

## Next Steps
- **Refine the AI_Node Class**: Explore task queuing and weighted prioritization for enhanced scalability.
- **Task Class Development**: Begin building a complementary `Task` class to standardize task metadata and execution logic.
- **Roadmap Revision**: Revise the project roadmap to incorporate lessons learned and ensure a smoother development process.
