# Node Network Project: Current Context

## Project Overview
The Node Network project is a collaborative AI system where specialized nodes from various AI models work together iteratively to solve complex tasks. These nodes are designed for specific purposes like coding, reviewing, and providing feedback, with recursive workflows to refine outputs.

---

## Current Task
**Step 12:** Document the project setup process in the portfolio.  
**Objective:** Write a `Setup.md` file with detailed instructions for setting up the project and link it in `portfolio.md`. Ensure the narrative fits the "follow along with me" style.

---

## Completed Work
1. **AI_Node Class**:
   - Implemented the base `AI_Node` class.
   - Documented it in `AI_Node.md` with reflections, challenges, and lessons learned.

2. **CI/CD Pipelines**:
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflows for linting (`flake8`) and testing (`pytest`).

3. **MkDocs Documentation**:
   - Installed MkDocs and the Material theme.
   - Structured documentation with sections for setup, API reference, and visuals.

---

## Challenges
1. Ensuring the documentation is beginner-friendly and professional.
2. Integrating CI/CD with MkDocs to automate updates to the documentation.

---

## Roadmap Progress
I am currently on step 12 of the roadmap, working on the **documentation of the project setup process**. Here’s an overview of progress so far:
- Steps 1–11: Completed project setup, implemented the base `AI_Node`, and established CI/CD pipelines.
- Next Steps: Expand the `Setup.md` file, deploy the MkDocs site, and integrate the documentation into the CI/CD workflow.

---

## Next Focus
- Write and commit `Setup.md` to the portfolio directory.
- Link `Setup.md` in `portfolio.md` under a "Setup Guide" section.
- Push changes and update GitHub.
